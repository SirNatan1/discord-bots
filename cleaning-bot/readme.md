pip install APScheduler
```

### **Step 2: Set Up Your Discord Bot**
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Create a new application.
3. Add a bot to the application.

### **Step 3: Configure the Bot**

```python
client.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')  # Replace this with your actual bot token
```

4. Replace `CLEANING_CHANNEL_ID` with the Discord channel ID where the bot should send cleaning reminders.

### **Step 4: Run the Bot**
Navigate to the folder where you saved `cleaning_bot.py` and run:

```bash
python cleaning_bot.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see `Logged in as <bot_name>` in your terminal, indicating that the bot is running.

### **Step 5: Invite the Bot to Your Server**
